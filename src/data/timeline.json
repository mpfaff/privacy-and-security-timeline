    "description": "Going against standard practice in the industry, Microsoft backs-up your BitLocker Recovery Keys in plain-text, rather than in an end-to-end encrypted form. Apple, on the other hand, backs-up your FileVault Recovery Key end-to-end encrypted as part of your keychain, rendering it entirely unreadable by them and, by extension, law enforcement.",

These documents were marked “for official use only”, and not authorized for public disclosure. CISA flagged the uploads in August of 2025, and conducted an internal review to assess potential impacts. Officials claim that despite the availability of DHS's DHSChat, Gottumukkala strongarmed CISA into giving him access to ChatGPT.",
